            <h3>Figma Wisdom Application</h3>
            <p>One of the most fun projects I've made, the idea of the application is to ease the reading process for those who enjoy it,<br> by making books available in pdf form, audio, or even physically.<br> also allowing users to add friends for community support, and exchange reviews of books they have read.</p>
